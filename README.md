#Fire_detection_using Deep Learning(out of NDA)

Fire detection using deep learning involves training neural networks to identify the presence of fire or smoke in images or videos. This is achieved by providing the model with labeled datasets containing examples of fire, smoke, and non-fire scenes. The deep learning model learns to extract features from the input data and make predictions based on these features. Once trained, the model can be deployed in real-time applications such as surveillance systems, fire alarms, or drones to detect and alert authorities to the presence of fires. Deep learning techniques offer advantages such as high accuracy, robustness to variations in lighting and environmental conditions, and the ability to continuously improve with more data.
